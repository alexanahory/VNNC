Virtual Nonlinear Nonholonomic constraints

This a repository containing the Python code and the video of the numerical simulation presented in section IV "Application" of the paper "Virtual nonlinear Nonholonomic constraints", by Efstratios Stratoglou, Alexandre Anahory Simoes, Anthony Bloch, and Leonardo Colombo.

Abstract: Virtual constraints are relations imposed on a control system that become invariant via feedback control, as opposed to physical constraints acting on the system. Non-holonomic systems are mechanical systems with non-integrable constraints on the velocities. In this work, we introduce the notion of virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints in a geometric framework which is a controlled invariant submanifold and we show the existence and uniqueness of a control law preserving this submanifold. We illustrate the theory with various examples and present simulation results for an application.
